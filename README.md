# EmergingTechAssessment

## Project Plan/Diary
* Github and file structures set up <br />
* Searching for information on MNIST dataset. On initial searches there are many articles and tutorials on the dataset so I’ll have a lot of sources to work with and learn from. <br />
* Look more into Keras (and TensorFlow), flask and Jupyter <br />
* Installed tensor flow, keras and panda on my machine. <br />
* Set up a basic webapp using Flash <br />
* MNIST dataset reading in and can printing out first image <br />
* CNN set up. Some problems exist and changes to be made. <br />
